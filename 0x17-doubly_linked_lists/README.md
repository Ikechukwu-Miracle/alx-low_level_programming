# 0x17. C - Doubly linked lists

This project is on C doubly linked lists.
In this project I learnt about all the features of the doubly linked list which makes it more useful than the singly linked list.
Im the DLL, we can traverse in both forward and backward directions.

There are a total of 12 tasks in the project:
9 Mandatory and 
3 Advanced tasks
